This will contain a part of Psuedo Random Generator for our 02201 Agile Hardware Design course at The Technical University of Denmark.

The repo, for now, will contain 2 algorithms (Salsa20 and ChaCha (Bernstien)), and there tests(test vector along with their expected results for each). 

The source code for both can be found under \src\main\scala\ .  
Their tests are present under \src\test\scala\ .   


SALSA20: 

The Port List for salsa20 contains input enciphered text and output ciphered text(and its implementation), but with they are commented out, as are not required by the scope of the project.
